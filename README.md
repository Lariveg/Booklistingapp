This is project is done for the Android Basics Nanodegree with Udacity. 

The project is about creating a Book Listing App. A user should be able to enter a keyword, press the search button, and recieve a list of published books which relate to that keyword.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:
Fetching data from an API
Using an AsyncTask
Parsing a JSON response
Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.

I put some screenshots with how the app looks in the screenshots directory.
